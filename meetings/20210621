Meeting Notes

Discussion points
- Performances of the algorithm should depends on:

  - Proportion of 0/1 for the response variable
  - The location of the true cutoff point, e.g., proportion of X1 that is greater (smaller) than the cutoff point
  - Sample size
  - Other covariates (X2, X3, X4, ...)

To-do 
- try cutoff point of 3 instead of 1
- round X1 in data generation phase
- increase number of covariates
- make code run faster for more replications

Coding styles
- Generate the `Rmd` in `pdf` for easiler view
- Avoid long line (lines that go off the pdf page width)

To-do for Steven
- Go through the codes to make it more efficient, e.g., fastglm
