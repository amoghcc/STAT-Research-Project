To-do
- Increase sample size
- Other covariates
- Use test data to calculate the concordance
- X1, X2, etc. correlated (using copula and/or MASS packages)
- What if there are more than one "x1"?

What we know so far?
- Algorithm performs well if
  - The cutpoint is not on one side of X1, e.g, mean(X1 > cp) is not 2% or 98%, etc
  - Increasing sample size improves the performance (slightly)
